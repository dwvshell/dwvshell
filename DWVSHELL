Topic and discussion : Pipeline Protection Safety Programs 
“Drain waste Ventilation Stockford Contaminate Pipeline shells”

My name is Richard Stockford and I’m a young entrepreneur currently in the process of developing and introducing  a new trade to our industry. 

“Ventilated” pipeline structure to properly secure pipeline systems. (Breathable units to allow the release of pressure and hold back fluid in faulty pipeline errors .) 

Maintaining containing and controlling lost fluid  product in an event of mechanical pipeline error. 

Involving engineering that will adapt to pipeline systems. 

Planned to be exercised and disciplined in many formats. 

Protecting and preserving products and services.

From drinking water , Crude oils and many more toxic fluid product ( abrasives), fluid is very important to everyday life and how it’s transferred. 

The programs  main goal is to save cost on clean up by capturing lost product releasing pressure  in the event of mechanical pipeline errors . 

The ventilation system will be designed to release  pressure and trap the the product fluid abrasives in the fluid chamber until the error is isolated and stabilized

Giving the time needed to Shut down and properly maintenance system . 


Why I’m here today. 

To get assistance with the development company I first started with and  or better options to help speed up developing process.  New  and inventive ways that is useful for today’s modern age state of the art pipeline that shall  adapt with our society.  

Reaching out for help with priority and focus:

Guidance 

Development & Protection of my Trade secret rights 

Investors / funding to move forward with projects



 I’m reaching out to you , 

I am here today to talk about my method to improve the way to properly transfer fluids in an environmentally safe manner. 

My invention is a new method to prevent spills and promote pipeline safety.

This raises a great awareness and should not be pushed away as it is very educational and learning experience.

Health and safety awareness in all areas.

Meaning if there is a preventable action that can be taken the government should be taking action and accountability  to help promote moving development forward. 

This is a team effort.

It will take care of our countryside, put people to work, and save fluid transfer costs.

These accidents happen due primarily to poor maintenance.

Below ground, for example, small leaks that cannot be identified eventually turns into a major problems without recognition.

These spills impact woodlands, farmers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, wildlife and our homes.

When you place something in the ground that is not properly maintained, designed, or engineered, major errors are bound to occur. 

In my view, this method is out of date, because any derailment tankers and pipelines provide little return on lost product. Leaving a huge carbon footprint. 

Waterways are also being contaminated by human waste, costing billions of dollars and impacting billions of litres of water. 

By not having properly function-able units, it’s very careless in my view.

My design can be used for putting in a solid securement system for fluid transfer via  pipelines.

The technology can be used for the whole length of the pipeline projects and will  allow for required shutdowns between facilities.

Having more Regulatory maintenance an up to date satisfaction.

In the case of trains, rather than a pipeline, you have the risk of ignition and fluid loss in derailments.

My system will eliminate these rail risks.

Safety is vital when properly transferring dangerous goods and my invention provides that railway shipment up to date demands. 

My multi-point plan for my system is as follows:

1. It will allow for the import and export of oil within our nation and beyond, including Alberta to New Brunswick and to USA , world wide refineries, without pipeline leaks, derailments or spill reports.

2. It will create jobs and reduce environmental damage by allowing work crews to maintain these pipelines in proper time.

3. It will move pipeline projects ahead in sensitive areas, making these environmentally friendly projects.

4. Pipelines will be easier to maintain as they can contain lost product in the event of a pipeline mechanical failure.  

5. My DWV Stockford contaminate pipeline shell is geared to be a fully ventilated pipeline structure to properly secure pipeline systems. 

6. Built for minor problems to prevent major issues. 

7. It will allow needed time for shutdowns, giving workers and engineers more confidence in pipeline maintenance.

8. It will save cost on clean up with the reuse of lost product. 

9. Improvements and enhancements will be made between my design firm (Davison), engineers, and corporations to determine the cost of the projects.

Under my plan, the key is DWVSCP simply stands for : 

D- Drain 
W- Waste
V- Ventilation
S- Secure/solid foundation
C- Containing contaminate fluids 
P-Pipeline 
S-structure 

Shell & Pipeline - Properly maintaining lost product via pipeline systems . 

The Drain Waste Ventilation {DWV} Stockford Contaminate Pipeline Shell. 

Varying and Depending on the direction of the pipeline, size and pressure (schedule), this will also vary on shell materials. . 

The outlook and design will honestly have many different designs and outlooks itself due to so many different pipeline projects,

Dealing with different terrain environment for the engineering that will be put into place to adapt to the goods and services it will be applying for.

With numerous pipeline instruments and material/ product being moved will affect future architectural designs and development for which assignment the projects will be assisting.

Original basic structure view will have different applications.




Components can and will change primary due to numerous: 

Fluid  products

Pipe fitting connections , Pipeline schedule (sizes) 

Pressure rating 

Assembly program can allow hose connections vs pipeline 

Allowing  various operation options 

Unwritten rule , the shape , the size , the Venting system , traffic (wildlife) by-pass , man way hatches can all be rearranged to make fit for project needs.

Materials can all vary do to the pipeline size,  connection for what is being transferred in the pipeline .

This can also be mobile or permanent placement. 

Existing and non-existing pipelines. 

The DWVSCPS will stand as its own separate structure completing pipeline projects secure pipeline instruments acting as a back up plan.

My ventilated pipeline structure's main asset is that it can clean up these spills by capturing lost product, and releasing pressure, in the event of mechanical pipeline errors.

Of course this could be single or multi purpose, as ESDs, valves and instruments can be set in place to aid and isolate the process.

This will make engineering pipelines more successful.

This tackles:

Produced Water

Waste facilities 

Toxic Chemicals

Oil companies & many more 

Promoting movement in pipeline industries. 

Giving people jobs while protecting the environment and resources . 
With the proper investor or investors, it will help us all move forward towards a successful future for a new way to promote and protect a state-of-the-art goal for pipeline safety.

From clean drinking water . To oil spills this shows  an act of appreciation and should not go unrecognized. 

790 million people live without clean drinking water daily .

They are counting on technology like this . To not waste such valuable priceless material. Water is more valuable then oil.

This raises a huge red flag for health and safety awareness. 

This means a lot to a lot of people that are in dire need for clean drinking water. Also 

Pipeline protection safety program protects and preserves H20. Safety of natural habitat and everyday lifestyle. 

I thank you for all your support. 

Followed by my PowerPoint presentation next,  this should give a wide view of basic project plans and what it needs to carry out strong compassion for a positive pipeline future. 

Also oil spills and I quote:

“Oil spills can have disastrous consequences for society, including economically, environmentally, and socially. “

“Because these accidents have initiated intense media attention and political uproar, in many cases bringing many together in a political struggle concerning government response to oil spills, something needs to be done to solve this concern”.

My system will prevent these concerns from happening in the first place.

Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - and Thinking green being concerned for our future.
